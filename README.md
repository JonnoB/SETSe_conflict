# Highly Sprung: understanding conflict in networks

This is the repo for the work used to understand whether SETSe can be used to analyse conlficts and thier outcomes on social networks with different relationship types.

The code builds on the paper [The spring bounces back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09437) and the associated repo  [assortativity and cluster](https://github.com/JonnoB/SETSe_assortativity_and_clusters)


This repo is a work in progress and may all end in tears
