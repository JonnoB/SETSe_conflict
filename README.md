# Highly Sprung: understanding conflict in networks

This is the repo for the work used to understand whether SETSe can be used to analyse conflicts and their outcomes on social networks with different relationship types.

The code builds on the paper [The spring bounces back](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-020-00329-4) and the associated repo  [assortativity and cluster](https://github.com/JonnoB/SETSe_assortativity_and_clusters)

The project uses the rsetse pacakge available from cran as [rsetse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsetse) or from the [github repo](https://github.com/JonnoB/rSETSe)


#Warning
This repo is a work in progress and may all end in tears
